# **Amarisoft MME + OAI eNB + srsUE**

Recently, I have successfully connected srsUE to OAI eNB and Amarisoft MME.

## Amarisoft MME
Amarisoft MME is a commercial EPC for LTE. It's homepage is [http://www.amarisoft.com/](http://www.amarisoft.com/).

## OAI eNB
OAI is an opensource SDR LTE project, in which the evolved node B (eNB), user equipment (UE) and evolved packet core (EPC) are being fully developed according to the 3GPP specification. Through our test, we find that the OAI eNB is trusty. However, the OAI EPC is hard to configure and the OAI UE is unstable to some extent. The source code and tutorials can be get from [https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g)

## srsUE
srsUE is an opensource SDR UE for LTE Release 8. The srsUE is very stable and trusty through our test. It's homepage is [http://www.softwareradiosystems.](http://www.softwareradiosystems.)  and you can get its source code from [https://github.com/srsLTE/srsUE](https://github.com/srsLTE/srsUE) and [http://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE](http://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE).

## Joint Test
As a result, we select Amarisoft MME, OAI eNB and srsUE to develop our stable SDR LTE system. Finally, we have successfully connected srsUE to OAI eNB and Amarisoft MME.

The screenshot is as follows.
