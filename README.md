Here is the blogpage from Xingguang Wei.

I am a master student of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interest includes Software Defined Radio (SDR), Long Term Evolution (LTE), new communications technologies and so on. Especially, I focus on the development of SDR LTE platforms, such as OpenAirInterface (OAI), srsLTE, srsUE, OpenLTE and Amarisoft.

Any comments about SDR, LTE and communications technologies are welcome. My email is jxwxg@foxmail.com
